/**
 * Tracks how many bytes this app has used today, separately for "total"
 * (any transport) and "mobile" (metered only), so [DownloadService] can
 * enforce the daily data limit settings.
 *
 * Reads [TrafficStats]' per-UID counters (Android's own rx/tx byte totals
 * for this app since last boot) rather than summing DownloadEngine/
 * TorrentEngine progress deltas -- those already double-count on resume
 * (re-downloading overlapping ranges) and don't cover yt-dlp's own
 * networking at all. TrafficStats counts every byte the app's UID moves
 * regardless of which engine did it.
 *
 * A session baseline is snapshotted whenever a new calendar day starts (or
 * on first use), and "today's usage" is just current-counter minus that
 * baseline -- so a device reboot mid-day (which resets TrafficStats to 0)
 * doesn't undercount: the baseline snapshot itself would already be stale
 * relative to a lower absolute value, but since we only ever compare
 * against a same-day baseline taken *after* that reboot when init() next
 * runs, the delta stays correct from that point forward. The rare case of
 * "reboot happens, then app is never reopened until next check" simply
 * means the pre-reboot portion of today's usage is lost, which matches
 * what any TrafficStats-based counter (including Android's own Settings >
 * Data usage) does across a reboot.

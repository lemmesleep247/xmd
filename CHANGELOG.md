# 📜 Changelog

All notable changes to **Xmd** are documented in this file.
The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) with pre-release identifiers (`-beta.N`, `-rc.N`, ...) leading up to `1.0.0`.

## [1.0.0-beta.6] - 2026-09-12

### ✨ Added
- 🎨 **Full UI migration to Jetpack Compose**, plus a **Material 3 Expressive theming overhaul** — filled icons, an expressive pill-shaped bottom nav, refined theme transitions, dialogs, and download cards across the app.
- 📸 **Instagram downloads** — reels, posts, and stories are now recognized and routed through the yt-dlp quality-picker flow, same as YouTube.
- 📤 **Floating background downloads for shared/external links** — links shared from other apps or opened externally now show a floating dialog and download in the background instead of requiring the main UI.
- 🗂️ **Duplicate-download detection** — path-based detection catches re-downloading a file already in the queue/library, with a resolution strategy (overwrite/rename/skip) instead of silently duplicating.
- ✅ **Multi-selection for downloads** — select multiple queue items for contextual bulk actions, with browser page gestures now isolated so they don't interfere.
- 🗂️ **Grid tabs for the browser** — live tab previews in a grid layout, a list-view switcher, and a Clear All action.
- 🔎 **Search engine selection** — pick your browser's default search engine or set a custom search URL.
- ▶️ **Background playback setting** for browser-played media, so audio/video keeps playing when you leave the browser.
- 🛡️ **Adblock overhaul** — remote-updated hosts list, path/pattern-based blocking, and cosmetic element hiding, on top of faster DNS-over-HTTPS resolution (disk cache, quicker timeouts, main-frame requests no longer proxied).
- 🔍 **Find in page, desktop-site toggle, and improved address bar** — reliable text selection, pinch-to-zoom, tap-to-show suggestions with current-page/clipboard rows, and duplicate-suggestion fixes.
- 🖱️ Chrome-style **swipe page transitions** between bottom navigation tabs.
- 🏠 **Home screen shortcuts** — pin any download link to the device home screen for one-tap re-download, with an "Add to home screen" flow and a toggle to remove shortcuts again.
- 🌐 **Custom browser home page** — Speed Dial, Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Bing, Yahoo, or a fully custom URL, instead of always opening Speed Dial.
- 🛡️ **Brave-style Shields** for the in-app browser — Standard/Aggressive/Off blocking levels, a per-site allowlist, and a lifetime blocked-count counter; site whitelisting now lives directly under Shields settings.
- 🗺️ **Google Translate in the browser overflow menu** — opens the current page through Google's web-proxy translator with a language picker.
- 📊 **Daily data limit** — cap total or mobile-only data use for downloads, configurable from Settings.
- 🔁 **Better expired/broken-link recovery** — a redesigned Link Expired dialog offers Retry, Fetch from Browser, or Cancel; retrying now tries a normal re-fetch first and only falls back to opening the browser (and finally a single-connection download) if that fails.
- 🎬 **In-page media picker on YouTube** — a floating "videos found" action appears on YouTube watch/Shorts pages, routing sniffed streams straight into the quality picker.
- 🔄 **Stable/Preview update channel selector** on the About screen, plus a clearer reason shown when an update check fails.
- 📚 **Libraries screen** added to About, crediting open-source dependencies, alongside a 72-hour on-disk avatar cache for the Developers section.
- 📂 **Open / Open Folder** actions on completed download items, and an **Open file location** entry in the downloads long-press sheet.
- ⏸️ **Pause/Resume All** for downloads, with Cancel/Retry/Clear All moved into a top-bar overflow menu, and empty filter chips now hide instead of showing with a zero count.
- 📋 Downloads gained a **copy-error option and a details dialog** for failed items.
- 🗒️ **Clipboard-based auto-start** for direct links, a **Start** chip button, and a magnet-glyph torrent icon.
- 🔍 Website source packs are now scanned from the **whole device**, not a single folder, with a redesigned picker card.
- ✅ **Link validation** in the Add Download dialog before a download starts, catching bad/unsupported links earlier.
- 📘 **Facebook link support** added to the downloader.
- ⏱️ **Completion stats on finished downloads** — duration (e.g. "Took 42s"), size, and localized date/time now shown on completed items, with more reliable filename probing for links.
- 🔎 **In-header settings button and search bar** integrated directly into the app header.
- 🎚️ **Video resolution and audio format dropdowns** added to the download dialog.
- 🌑 **AMOLED dark mode toggle** in theme settings.
- 🎨 **New launcher icon set**, including a proper monochrome silhouette for Android 13+ themed (Monet) icons.

### 🛠 Fixed
- 📤 Sharing a link from YouTube into Xmd no longer keeps the wrong/stale name on the queued item.
- 🧩 Settings has been reorganised for clearer grouping now that Data Limit, Libraries, and the update-channel picker all live there too.
- 🩹 An invalid `--` sequence in an XML comment that could break the manifest merge on release builds, plus other XML-comment syntax errors that were breaking CI.
- ⏳ A stuck yt-dlp queue placeholder that could persist after a download finished, and standalone leftover thumbnail files.
- 📝 About-screen layout and manifest fixes.
- 🧭 The Downloads tab now shows "Downloads" as its header title instead of a generic label.
- 🏗️ Crash opening Appearance settings (vector drawables now used instead of selectors for tab icons), and a Home-tab build failure from a non-lifecycle-aware `StateFlow` collector.
- 🧭 System bars now sync correctly with theme transitions instead of flashing the wrong color, and the floating nav bar shadow no longer clips.
- 📶 Network-gone strings and behavior corrected on the Home tab.

### 🎨 Changed
- 🌐 Site whitelisting for the browser moved from a standalone list into the new Shields settings section, with direct Add from there.
- 🧵 Internal refactor: duplicated logic across UI components, dialogs, and formatters consolidated to cut repeated code, and the project folder structure was reorganized.
- 📦 R8 code minification and resource shrinking re-enabled for release builds.
- 🐛 Debug builds now integrate LeakCanary for memory-leak detection during development.

## [1.0.0-beta.5] - 2026-08-29



### ✨ Added
- 🔖 **Real Bookmarks feature** — the star button now saves/removes a proper bookmark (its own DB table) instead of a shortcut, with a new Bookmarks screen (search, swipe-to-delete, Clear all) off the browser overflow menu; the old speed-dial "Bookmark" tiles are renamed to **Shortcut** throughout, with an "Also add as Shortcut" option when bookmarking.
- ⚙️ **Settings redesigned** into a full-screen categorized layout, plus a new **About** screen with a developers/credits section.
- 🗂️ **Tabs tray redesign** — the Tabs dialog is now a bottom sheet instead of a modal `AlertDialog`: pill-shaped rows with round icon avatars and a floating "+" action for opening a new tab.
- 🧲 **Shortcuts**: custom icon override, drag-to-reorder (saved on Done), and fixes for icon clipping and an edit-order bug.
- 🚫 **Domain-blocklist ad blocking** for the in-app browser — new Settings > Browser category, on by default.
- 📤 **Export Websites** (SAF save + share), alongside the existing import; both now live under Browser settings instead of Downloads.
- 🔍 **Search in the Downloads tab**, filtering the queue by file name or source URL, with its own "No matching downloads" empty state.
- 🔗 The browser now handles `fb://` and `intent://` links instead of failing with `ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME`.
- 📎 Restored **Copy link** on the Add to Downloads dialog, plus a long-press menu (Open with / Rename / Re-download / Copy download link / Share / Delete) on finished/failed downloads.
- 🎬 Direct `.m3u8`/`.mpd` links are now routed through yt-dlp instead of downloaded raw.
- 🎨 Three new themes: **Tokyo Night**, **Gruvbox**, and **Amethyst**.
- ⚡ Faster search suggestions — instant in-memory history matches, debounce cut from 300ms to 150ms.
- 🔗 The "yt-dlp not installed" dialog's Install button now deep-links straight to Settings > YouTube.

### 🛠 Fixed
- 🎥 Video playback on non-YouTube sites — Range requests used for streaming/seeking were being routed through a DoH proxy whenever a Private DNS mode was set, silently breaking playback everywhere except YouTube's own player pipeline; media and Range requests now bypass the proxy.
- 🔐 Google sign-in no longer fails to persist (removed a WebView UA marker Google blocks, cookies now flushed on pause), and `Set-Cookie` headers from DoH-intercepted requests are now forwarded into `CookieManager` instead of being dropped.
- ⬇️ Multi-connection resume no longer restarts from scratch on a share-link retry, and notification updates are now actually throttled as intended instead of firing unthrottled on every progress tick.
- 🎨 Theme changes now apply immediately from Settings instead of requiring a relaunch.
- ⚙️ Settings icons no longer lose their detail glyphs under tint; the YouTube settings row is correctly hidden on the `lite` flavor.
- 💾 YouTube/Downloads settings now persist immediately on change — no more Save buttons to remember to tap.
- 🩹 Assorted invalid XML-comment (`--`) fixes that were breaking release builds.

### 🎨 Changed
- 📥 Website import/export moved from Downloads settings to Browser settings, where it fits better alongside the adblock toggle.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-08-28

### ✨ Added
- 🖱️ **Chrome-style long-press menu** — long-press a link or image in the Browser for open-in-new-tab, open-image-in-new-tab, download image, copy link address, and share link, anchored right at the touch point.
- 🔍 **History search** — the History tab now has a search box filtering by title/URL.
- 🕓 **History-aware address bar suggestions** — matching visited pages now show above Google's search-phrase suggestions, each with its own icon.
- 🖥️ **Desktop site toggle** — per-tab overflow menu item that swaps the UA + wide viewport and forces a genuine reload (not served from cache under the old UA).
- 🔎 **Find in page** — Chrome-style overlay bar with prev/next navigation and a live match count.
- ⌨️ **Bottom navigation auto-hides** while the keyboard is open (paste-links box, address bar, find-in-page, any dialog input) instead of floating above the keys.
- 🎚️ **Video preset settings** — pick a preferred container, codec, and FPS ladder for the quick quality picks, plus a default **audio format** (MP3, M4A, Opus, or Original) for Audio-only downloads.
- 📊 **Advanced quality section** — a real yt-dlp format probe (`--dump-json`) surfaced as a collapsible list in the quality picker, showing exact FPS/codec/file size per stream alongside the standard quality ladder.
- 🗂️ **Overflow menu regrouped** into page actions, privacy actions, history, and settings sections for easier scanning.

### 🛠 Fixed
- 🩹 Container/FPS/Codec preset fields in Settings no longer wrap mid-word (e.g. "WebM" splitting into "We"/"bM") — smaller text plus single-line/ellipsize.
- 🎵 The Audio-only row in the quality picker now shows your actual saved audio format (MP3/M4A/Opus/Original) instead of always reading "(MP3)"; a saved "Audio only" default quality also survives a later format change instead of silently reverting to "Ask always".
- 🧭 Downloads tab's Cancel All / Clear All buttons were rendering underneath the bottom navigation bar and never visible — fragment content now clears the nav bar's height properly.
- 🔢 30fps entries in the Advanced quality list weren't labeled with their fps, making them indistinguishable from formats with no fps data — all formats now show their real fps.
- 🖼️ Speed-dial favicons switched from a memory-only cache to a 24-hour on-disk cache, so icons no longer redownload on every cold app launch.
- 🕰️ Fixed the history clock icon rendering as a solid dot instead of an outline, and search-suggestion rows showing the wrong (link) icon instead of a search icon.
- 🔔 Download-started snackbar reliability: no longer appears while already sitting on the Downloads tab, and no longer goes missing on Home/Browser from tab-switch timing races.
- 🏗️ Fixed the `lite` flavor build breaking after the yt-dlp format-probe API was added (its stub `YtDlpManager` needed matching method signatures).

### 🗑️ Removed
- 🕵️ Private browsing tabs' toolbar entry point (the dedicated "New Private Tab" button), pulled back before release.

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-08-26

### ✨ Added
- 📤 **Transparent Share-Receiver** for external downloads — sharing a link from another app (e.g. Morphe's "External downloads" hook) into Xmd no longer bounces the caller app off-screen. A new transparent `ShareReceiverActivity` handles the `SEND` intent directly: YouTube links get a quick bottom-sheet quality picker, everything else (direct/torrent links) queues and starts silently, and the caller app stays in the foreground throughout.
- 🕵️ **In-browser media sniffing** — a new `MediaSniffer` classifier detects HLS/DASH/direct media requests as pages load, surfacing a "videos found" chip and picker sheet in the Browser so streamed media can be grabbed without hunting for a direct link.
- 📶 **Download on Wi-Fi Only** setting (off by default) — live downloads (HTTP, torrent, and YouTube) automatically pause when Wi-Fi drops and resume when it's back; the queue shows "Waiting for Wi-Fi" instead of a generic paused state.
- 🎚️ **Default YouTube quality** setting — choose "Ask always" or lock in a fixed quality to skip the picker sheet on every download.
- 🌐 **Expanded Private DNS options** — added Google DNS and Cloudflare (plain + adblock) DoH providers alongside AdGuard; the list now shows each provider's DoH address as a subtitle, with "Off" reordered to the top.
- 👆 **Tap-to-jump stats pill** — tapping the done/failed count on Home now jumps straight to the relevant Downloads tab.
- 🧲 External torrent links found while browsing can now be added directly from the web.

### 🛠 Fixed
- 🎥 Cleartext HTTP pages (older blogs, direct file hosts) no longer fail to load, and autoplay/JS-triggered `<video>`/`<audio>` no longer hangs on a spinner waiting for a manual tap.
- ❌ Queued items can now be properly cancelled/cleared, and incomplete downloads are rejected instead of being incorrectly marked as `DONE`.
- 🎨 Fixed the theme toggle's tap target (previously too large), bumped header title size, and added a Settings shortcut to the browser's overflow menu.
- 📊 Polished the Browser progress bar (elevation/corners) and snackbar (theme-aware background color).
- 🩹 Fixed two more invalid `--` sequences inside XML comments that were breaking the databinding parser and release builds.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-24

### ✨ Added
- 🧲 **Built-in torrent support** — download magnet links and `.torrent` files directly in-app, with a dedicated Add Torrent confirmation dialog and magnet icon. Torrents can also be added from links found while browsing.
- ▶️ **YouTube downloads via yt-dlp** — new `full` build flavor bundles yt-dlp + ffmpeg for a quality-picker download flow; the existing `lite` flavor (FuckingFast/direct/fitgirl/torrent only) stays unchanged in size and dependencies. Both flavors split per-ABI (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`), for four release APKs total.
- 🔄 **yt-dlp Update controls** — manual Update button and a Stable/Nightly release-channel switch in Settings; the 24h background auto-update now follows the saved channel instead of a hardcoded one.
- 🖼️ **Proper audio thumbnails** for yt-dlp downloads, plus an **Open** button on finished downloads and download stats for YouTube items.
- 📋 **YouTube clipboard detection**, Google-powered address bar suggestions, a bookmark star toggle, and website import; default bookmarks removed from fresh installs.
- 🪟 **Per-tab WebView pool** in the Browser for instant tab switching, cross-tab back history, and no stale history/old-page flash on a fresh tab.
- 🧭 **Chrome-style toolbar rework** — new tab / search / reload / tabs / overflow — fixing it from reappearing over content after a background-kill activity recreation.
- 🎨 **Material 3 Expressive redesign** across the entire UI — dialogs, switches, buttons, and layouts rebuilt with Material 3 components.
- 🌈 **5 built-in themes** — Default, Aurora, Nord, Dracula, and Catppuccin — with app colors migrated to theme attributes for consistent dynamic theming.
- ☀️ **Light theme** — every color theme now has a light variant; flip it from the new Dark Mode switch in Settings > Appearance, or with a single tap on the app header.

### 🛠 Fixed
- ⏯️ Manual Resume/Cancel now survive a killed process over long pauses; auto-retry defaults to **off**.
- 📉 Eliminated download list flicker on progress ticks and fixed the notification getting stuck on "Preparing" when paused.
- 🌀 Fixed tab-switch lag, cross-tab back-history handling, and old-page flash on Browser navigation.
- 🔐 Fixed a Material 3 `AlertDialog` theme crash and general theme-consistency polish.
- 🩹 Fixed an XML namespace typo (`file_paths.xml`) and an XML comment syntax error that were breaking CI builds.
- 🌐 DoH resolver concurrency fix for more reliable Private DNS resolution.
